PyCity Schools Analysis:

-after analysing the Schools data provided, it is fair say that charter schools have a better performance than their peers in the district side, ocuping the first 5 positions in term of overall grades. 

-contrary to popular believe, schools with higher budgets do not perform considerably better to those with lower ones.

-small schools tent to have better performance in both reading and math and overall percentage of passing .
